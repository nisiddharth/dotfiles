## Packages

[apt_installed.txt](./apt_installed.txt) has list of APT packages needed to be installed. [apt_for_ctf.txt] has list of APT packages needed to be installed if installation will be used to play CTFs (and isn't Kali/Parrot).

[i8k_configuration.md](./i8k_configuration.md) has instructions for how to manually configure dell laptop fan bios control in linux systems.
