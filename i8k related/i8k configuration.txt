Dell Inspiron 5593 fan control setup:

Researched from: https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/controlling-dell-fan-speeds-temperature-on-ubuntu-debian-linux/, http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages//precise/man1/i8kmon.1.html, https://askubuntu.com/questions/522954/setting-temperature-thresholds-in-i8kmon-ubuntu-14-04, https://askubuntu.com/questions/1227489/i8kctl-not-working-for-dell-inspiron-fan-control.

1. `sudo apt install lm-sensors`, it will allow us to monitor temperature of cpu and fan speeds via `sensors` command.

2. `sudo apt install i8kutils`, this has i8k, the driver and utility which will help us control the fan.

3. `sudo modprobe -v i8k` will load i8k driver.

4. git clone https://github.com/TomFreudenberg/dell-bios-fan-control.git
  cd dell-bios-fan-control
  make
  sudo ./dell-bios-fan-control 0
  
  to disable bios control of fans.
  
  If you get an error like this

	ioperm:: Operation not permitted 
	ioperm:: Operation not permitted [1] 
	4701 segmentation fault
	you need to go to your BIOS/UEFI and disable SECURE BOOT. Then run the command again. Output should now be BIOS CONTROL DISABLED.

5. If everything has worked till now `sudo i8kctl fan 2 2` should put your fans at full speed.

6. Now open /etc/i8kmon.conf in a text editor `sudo nano /etc/i8kmon.conf` and put the following in it:

# Run as daemon, override with --daemon option
set config(daemon)      0

# Automatic fan control, override with --auto option
set config(auto)        1

# External program to control the fans
set config(i8kfan)	/usr/bin/i8kfan

# Report status on stdout, override with --verbose option
set config(verbose)	1

# Status check timeout (seconds), override with --timeout option
set config(timeout)	5

# Temperature threshold at which the temperature is displayed in red
set config(t_high)	80

# Temperature thresholds: {fan_speeds low_ac high_ac low_batt high_batt}
# These were tested on the Inspiron 5593. If you have a different Dell laptop model
# you should check the BIOS temperature monitoring and set the appropriate
# thresholds here. In doubt start with low values and gradually rise them
# until the fans are not always on when the cpu is idle.
set config(0)   {{-1 0}  -1  40  -1  40}
set config(1)   {{-1 1}  40  60  40  60}
set config(2)   {{-1 2}  60  128  60  128}
set config(3)   {{-1 2}  60  128  60  128}

# Speed values are set here to avoid i8kmon probe them at every time it starts.
set status(leftspeed)	"0 1000 2000 3000"
set status(rightspeed)	"0 1000 2000 3000"

# end of file

Remember to replace those {-1 0} things with specific to your laptop. -1 signifies my laptop doesn't have a left fan. If you have both fans put {0 0}, if only right {0 -1}. Refer manpage for more details.

7. Create /etc/modprobe.d/i8k.conf with this line inside it:
	options i8k force=1

8. Thats it. Reboot your system and enjoy a cooler laptop.

----------------------

To check status of i8kmon service:
	sudo systemctl status i8kmon.service
To start it:
	sudo systemctl start i8kmon.service
To stop it:
	sudo systemctl stop i8kmon.service

----------------------

To heat CPU cores for checking i8k fan control you can do a stress test using:
	`stress -c 8`
	
press ctrl+c to cancel.
